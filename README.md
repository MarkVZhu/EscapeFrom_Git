## Desciption
Due to limited space, I only describe one important part of the code sample in this project. The script - GravityChange.cs - in the **Environment** folder defines how the character reverses the path in the first level. This program is the key that contributes to the level design and gameplay of the first scene. To know more details, please read the documentation of this game.
